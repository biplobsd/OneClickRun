# Development Guide: A guide on setting up this project for development.

## 1. Go to the OneClickRun repository and Fork it.

- A fork is a rough copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely test and debug with changes without affecting the original project. One of the excessive use of forking is to propose changes for bug fixing.
